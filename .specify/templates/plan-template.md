# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Principle I: Rails Convention over Configuration**
- [ ] Using Rails generators for all models, migrations, controllers
- [ ] Following RESTful routing patterns
- [ ] Leveraging ActiveRecord patterns appropriately

**Principle II: Mobile-First Progressive Enhancement**
- [ ] Mobile viewport (320px minimum) designed first
- [ ] Touch-friendly interfaces
- [ ] Progressive enhancement to desktop

**Principle III: Hotwire-Powered Real-time UX**
- [ ] Using Turbo for navigation without full page reloads
- [ ] Stimulus controllers for interactivity
- [ ] No separate API layer unless justified

**Principle IV: Testing Standards**
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage planned (can be written before, during, or after implementation)
- [ ] Minimum 80% code coverage target
- [ ] Model, request, and system specs planned
- [ ] All tests must pass before delivery

**Principle V: Domain-Driven Design**
- [ ] Business logic in models and service objects
- [ ] Thin controllers
- [ ] Clear domain boundaries

**Principle VI: User Acceptance Validation via Browser Testing**
- [ ] Playwright MCP testing planned for user stories
- [ ] Desktop and mobile viewport validation
- [ ] User story validation checklist prepared

**Principle VII: Visual Consistency and Design System**
- [ ] Using standardized Tailwind slate dark theme colors
- [ ] Following existing component patterns
- [ ] Responsive design validation planned

**Principle VIII: Quality Gates and Delivery Standards**
- [ ] bin/check compliance planned (RSpec, Rubocop, Brakeman)
- [ ] Maximum test coverage strategy defined
- [ ] Quality gate validation in final phase

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
