# Specification Quality Checklist: Gestão de Transações

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

✅ **PASSED** - All quality checks passed on first iteration (2025-10-18)

### Key Strengths:
- 5 well-prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) with clear independent test criteria
- 35 functional requirements covering all aspects: CRUD operations, recurring transactions, filtering, deletion, and balance calculation
- 10 measurable success criteria focused on user experience and system integrity
- 10 documented assumptions to fill specification gaps without requiring clarification
- All edge cases identified and resolved via assumptions with clear references

### Spec Readiness:
The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. You may proceed with:
- `/speckit.plan` - to create implementation plan
- Direct implementation - if no planning needed

## Notes

No issues found. Specification meets all quality criteria.
