# Tasks: Account Management (Gest√£o de Contas Financeiras)

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/angeliski/workspace/my-money/specs/001-account-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/routes.md

**Tests**: Tests are included in this feature (comprehensive RSpec test coverage required per Constitution Principle IV)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions (Rails Monolith)
- **Models**: `app/models/`
- **Controllers**: `app/controllers/`
- **Views**: `app/views/accounts/`
- **Services**: `app/services/`
- **JavaScript**: `app/javascript/controllers/`
- **Specs**: `spec/models/`, `spec/requests/`, `spec/system/`, `spec/factories/`
- **Migrations**: `db/migrate/`
- **I18n**: `config/locales/pt-BR/`
- **Routes**: `config/routes.rb`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Phase 3): Create first account - MVP foundation
  - US2 (Phase 4): View account list - Depends on US1 for display
  - US5 (Phase 5): Create multiple accounts - Extends US1 functionality
  - US3 (Phase 6): Edit account - Requires US1 and US2 for context
  - US4 (Phase 7): Archive account - Requires US2 for list filtering
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Phase 3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 (needs accounts to display)
- **User Story 5 (P1 - Phase 5)**: Extends US1 (reuses creation flow, tests multiple types)
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (needs accounts to edit and view updates)
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Phase 7)**: Depends on US2 (needs list view for filtering archived)

### Within Each User Story

- Controllers before views (views reference controller actions)
- Views before JavaScript controllers (Stimulus controllers target view elements)
- Request specs test controller behavior
- System specs test full user flows with JavaScript
- Each story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T001, T002, T003 can run sequentially (Rails generators must run in order)
- T004 runs after migrations generated

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T005, T006, T007 (models) can run in parallel - different files
- T008, T009 (factories) can run in parallel after models complete - different files
- T010, T011, T012 (model specs) can run in parallel after factories complete - different files

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T015, T016, T019, T020, T021, T022 can run in parallel after T014 - different files
- T023, T024 can run in parallel - different spec files

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T027, T028, T029, T030, T033 can run in parallel after T026 - different files
- T034, T035, T036 can run in parallel - different spec files

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- T066, T067, T068, T069, T070 can run in parallel - different concerns
- T076-T084 (browser tests) can run in parallel - independent test scenarios

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After T014 (routes configured), launch these tasks in parallel:
Task: "Generate AccountsController with rails generate controller"  # T015
Task: "Implement AccountsHelper with balance formatting methods"     # T016
Task: "Create I18n translations file for Portuguese strings"        # T019
Task: "Create accounts/new.html.erb view with Turbo Frame modal"    # T020
Task: "Create accounts/_form.html.erb partial"                      # T021
Task: "Implement account_form_controller.js Stimulus controller"    # T022

# After T017-T022 complete, launch specs in parallel:
Task: "Write request spec for POST /accounts"                       # T023
Task: "Write system spec for creating first account"                # T024
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 + 5 Only - All P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T013) **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T025) - Create first account
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T026-T037) - View account list
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 5 (T038-T043) - Create multiple accounts
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
7. Run browser tests (T076-T078, T081)
8. Deploy MVP if ready

**MVP Value**: Users can create, view, and manage multiple accounts of different types - core functionality complete

### Incremental Delivery (Add P2 Features)

1. Complete MVP (Phases 1-5)
2. Add Phase 6: User Story 3 (T044-T053) - Edit account functionality
3. Test US3 independently, verify US1/US2/US5 still work
4. Add Phase 7: User Story 4 (T054-T065) - Archive account functionality
5. Test US4 independently, verify all previous stories still work
6. Complete Phase 8: Polish (T066-T084)
7. Full feature validation and deployment

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Phase 2 completes):

**Parallel Track 1** (MVP Critical Path):
- Developer A: US1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí US2 (Phase 4) sequentially
- These must be sequential as US2 depends on US1

**Parallel Track 2** (MVP Enhancement):
- Developer B: US5 (Phase 5) - Can start after US1 completes

**Parallel Track 3** (P2 Features - after MVP):
- Developer C: US3 (Phase 6) - Can start after US2 completes
- Developer D: US4 (Phase 7) - Can start after US2 completes

**Parallel Track 4** (Polish - after all stories):
- Developer E: Browser testing (T076-T084)
- Developer F: Performance and accessibility (T082-T084)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can be executed simultaneously
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Always run specs after implementation to verify functionality
- Use Rails generators for migrations, models, and controllers (Constitution requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group (not specified per task to reduce verbosity)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution Principle IV requires comprehensive tests - all specs are mandatory
- Constitution Principle VI requires browser testing with Playwright MCP - T076-T081 are mandatory
- Constitution Principle VIII requires bin/check quality gates - T071-T075 are mandatory
- All code in English, all user-facing text in pt-BR via i18n (Constitution code language conventions)
