# Specification Quality Checklist: Gestão de Contas Financeiras

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Analysis
✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on business requirements without mentioning Rails, controllers, models, or specific gems.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories explain the value and priority, centered on user needs (financial organization, visibility, data integrity).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain Portuguese, avoiding technical jargon. Even entities are described conceptually.

✅ **All mandatory sections present**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all completed with substantial content.

### Requirement Completeness Analysis
✅ **No clarification markers**: All 25 functional requirements are specific and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

✅ **Requirements testable**: Each requirement uses clear language ("Sistema DEVE permitir...", "Sistema DEVE validar...") with specific conditions that can be verified.

✅ **Success criteria measurable**: All 10 success criteria include quantifiable metrics:
- Time-based: "menos de 30 segundos", "menos de 2 segundos", "menos de 3 segundos", "menos de 5 segundos"
- Accuracy-based: "100% das contas", "precisão de 100%"
- Capacity-based: "no mínimo 50 contas"

✅ **Success criteria technology-agnostic**: All criteria describe user outcomes and system behavior without mentioning implementation details:
- ❌ Bad: "API responds in 200ms"
- ✅ Good: "Sistema exibe lista de contas com atualização de saldos em tempo real (menos de 2 segundos após transação)"

✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: 5 user stories with 4 acceptance scenarios each (20 total), covering main flows and edge cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases documented covering:
- Duplicate names, future transactions, archiving only account, all archived, unarchiving, immutability, concurrent access

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Feature limited to account management (CRUD + archiving). Clearly excludes transaction implementation, reporting details, and family management UI. Family association is automatic and invisible to user.

✅ **Dependencies identified**: Implicit dependencies documented in edge cases and functional requirements:
- FR-006: Depends on transaction system for balance calculation
- FR-020: Depends on transaction history feature
- Multiple requirements reference "relatórios" indicating reporting system dependency

### Feature Readiness Analysis
✅ **Functional requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each of the 25 FRs maps to specific acceptance scenarios in the user stories. For example:
- FR-001 (criar conta) → User Story 1, scenarios 2-3
- FR-008 (listar contas) → User Story 2, scenario 1
- FR-014 (arquivar) → User Story 4, scenarios 1-2

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 user stories prioritized as P1, P2, covering:
- P1: Create first account, view list, create multiple accounts (MVP critical path)
- P2: Edit account, archive account (maintenance functions)

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria aligned with user stories, covering performance, accuracy, capacity, and user experience.

✅ **No implementation leaks**: Specification maintains abstraction layer. References to "sistema" rather than specific components. Even Key Entities section describes conceptual data without database schema details.

## Notes

**Specification is complete and ready for next phase.**

The specification successfully:
1. Defines clear user value through 5 prioritized user stories
2. Documents 25 testable functional requirements
3. Identifies 7 important edge cases
4. Establishes 10 measurable success criteria
5. Describes key entities conceptually without implementation details
6. Maintains focus on family financial management domain

**Recommended next steps:**
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- Consider `/speckit.clarify` if any ambiguities arise during planning

**Key strengths:**
- Strong focus on family-shared data model (invisible to user)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-prioritized user stories (P1 focuses on MVP critical path)
- Clear distinction between active and archived accounts
- Audit trail requirements properly scoped as backend-only

**No blocking issues found.**
